# Blogging for business notes

## 1.1: what's the goal? Traffic or something else?

For me, probably not raw traffic. It's not sales either, since I'm not selling anything, but it's either inbound leads for consulting work, or some amount of prestige/portfolio to show to potential future employers

## 1.2 Main acquisition channels

- word of mouth
- search
- ads

Blogs can help with all three channels - although advertising is the weakest of them. Overall, it helps with search ranks, and when it comes to word of mouth/recommendations, it gives a tangible link to send to other people.
