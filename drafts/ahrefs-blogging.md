# Blogging for business notes

## 1.1: what's the goal? Traffic or something else?

For me, probably not raw traffic. It's not sales either, since I'm not selling anything, but it's either inbound leads for consulting work, or some amount of prestige/portfolio to show to potential future employers

## 1.2 Main acquisition channels

- word of mouth
- search
- ads

Blogs can help with all three channels - although advertising is the weakest of them. Overall, it helps with search ranks, and when it comes to word of mouth/recommendations, it gives a tangible link to send to other people.

## 1.3 why most blogs fail

Content marketing effors need to add up over time - otherwise we're just surviving. You want passive growth on existing content. We're looking for compound effects.

You want passive, consistent traffic over the "spike of hope". Then you want to convert that traffic into leads/sales.

## 2.1 spike of hope

Basically no new people in the spike of hope. Generally existing traffic. Even when you share with niche communities - you get diminishing returns because niches get saturated.

So the spike is:

1. Existing audience (no new)
2. Niche community sharing (get saturated)
3. Word of mouth (10-20% sharing). Most visitors can't bring in traffic themselves. But big influencers could (this is rare).

Growth requires new audiences all the time. SEO is the key here, and takes time to build up. 

## 2.2 Two major strategies for growing blog

1. Viral traffic - generate buzz
2. SEO - get ranked in Google

Basically two extreme cases on a spectrum. 

Viral - make it sticky. Resonate with target audience. They can't resist sharing. 
Viral - pitch to influences who will promote to larger audiences
Viral - lots of publishing

SEO - make it useful, but doesn't need to be as sticky
SEO - backlinks. Building backlinks is hard.
SEO - don't need to publish regularly. it doesn't fade like virality.

- Viral content isn't exponential growth. It actually decays.
- Viral content has to be exposed to a huge audience. But the virality fades over time.

## 2.3 Bustin publish more often myth

SEO traffic doesn't require publishing a huge amount of content.

1. Make content around specific keywords, and make that rank well.
1. You can build a whole business off one article.

Focus efforts on a few keystone articles and get them to rank.

Viral traffic is a gamble, SEO traffic is repeatable.
