This is a series of questions for engineers to do their own self reflections for their performance reviews.

There is only one required question. The others are all optional. Answer as many or as few optional questions as you like. In any response, there is no word minimum or maximum. This is mostly an exercise to help us give you the best feedback we can, and to prompt your own self reflection.

These questions and answers can be kept private between you and Tyler if you ask for it, although the overall results of the performance review will made available to WalterPicks management/ownership, and may include references or quotes from the answers. Reach out if you have any questions or concerns about that.

Please send your selected questions and answers to Tyler by the evening of Thursday, February 16th, 2023. If you need more time, please reach out to Tyler and we can work something out.

If you want to keep your responses private, please send Tyler a google doc or some other medium that is not in Basecamp/Slack. We'll discuss how to keep things private, and what will be shared more broadly.

(Required) What are your goals? Please answer at least one of these items, but you can pick and choose from them as you like. Useful framings for this question might be:

Time-based goals:
For the next 6 months
For the next 1 year
For the next 3 years
For the next 5+ years
Career-focused goals:
What specific skills or knowledge would you like to acquire?
Do you have any goals around taking on more leadership, or are you less interested in that?
How would you like the WalterPicks team to think of you and your tenure here?
If and when you move on to new endeavors, what would you like your network to think of your work at WalterPicks? How would you want your current coworkers to think of you in the future?
Life-focused goals:
Do you want to change your work/life balance in any way?
Do you have long-term life aspirations?
Do you have any more open ended life goals you'd like to share?
What kind of constructive criticism would you expect us to give you? How would you provide it to yourself?

Is there anything you're particularly proud of in the last 6-12 months? What is it? Why are you proud of it? What did you learn from it?

What was your biggest challenge this year and how did you overcome it? Do you want to handle more challenges similar to that one, or do you want to avoid those kinds of challenges in the future?

What specific skills have you developed or improved upon in the last 6-12 months? What was the most fun to learn, and/or what was the least fun to learn?

What do you feel is your greatest strength and how have you leveraged it in the last 6-12 months?

Instead of your greatest "strength", what is the thing you like doing the most (regardless of how strong you feel at it), and how have you exercised it in the last 6-12 months?

What kind of self improvement activities have you engaged in during the last 6-12 months? Some prompts for this would be:
Have you tried any time management/prioritization techniques? What worked/didn't work for you?
Have you tried to improve your communication skills? How so? What worked/didn't work?
Have you tried improving your decision making skills? Either by making faster or better decisions? What worked/didn't?
What kind of self-reflection activities have you engaged in during the last 6-12 months? What worked/didn't?
How do you feel about the last 6-12 months of your work/life balance?

What kind of work accomplishments are you proud to share with friends and family? Is there any kind of accomplishment you wish you had that you could share with them? If so, what is it?

Are there any gaps in the way your current day-to-day work fails to meet your long term goals? Either based on the type of work you're doing, or in your own assessment of your success in those endeavors?

Are there any tasks that you are repeatedly doing that don't serve your goals or the business, but you feel obligated to continue doing? If so, what are they? Do you want to explore how we can get these off your plate?

Do you feel like you have a good support system at WalterPicks? What could be done to improve it?

How do you approach giving and receiving feedback? Do you have any suggestions on how we could improve our feedback culture?

What opportunities have you taken to mentor, guide, or help your colleagues this year? What have you learned from those experiences?

What kind of work environment do you thrive in?

Read through this article and come back with some targeted feedback solicitation: https://larahogan.me/blog/get-feedback-from-colleagues/. Your answer to this question should be in the form of questions for Tyler or the rest of the team.

Finally, feel free to include any open ended question/answer or commentary.
