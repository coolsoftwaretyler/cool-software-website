# Should I use React Native for my application?

If you're just looking for the correct answer, here it is: yes. Use React Native for that app idea you have.

If you want to know why, read on:

## Who you are

You're a non-technical founder. You have an idea for an app. Maybe you know it should be a mobile app. Maybe you know it needs to have a mobile app and a web app. Maybe you're not sure if you need a mobile app, a web app, or something else.

You want to get to market quickly. You want to be able to pivot your business as you iterate and experiment. You want a large pool of available engineering talent to hire. You don't want to get locked in to obscure technologies that are difficult to change and maintain.

Well hey, if that's you? You need to be using React Native.

It's the best tool for your use case. You'll be able to use a shared codebase across iOS, Android, and web apps. You'll have an easy time finding developers who already know React Native, or who can learn React Native very quickly. Your user experiences will be truly native - React Native apps compile down to the actual platform you're targeting. You can rest easy knowing React Native is stable: backed by large companies like Meta and Microsoft, and loved by a substantial open source community.

## Save money and get to market faster with a shared codebase

By utilizing a shared codebase, you can save time and resources on development. Instead of having to staff separate teams for iOS, Android, and web development, a single developer or development team can write code that can be used across all platforms. While you won't get 100% shared code, you can still reuse a significant portion of your work, likely around 40-50%, which can lead to substantial savings and faster time to market. With React Native, you can build a high-quality app for multiple platforms with fewer developers, reducing the complexity and costs of your project.

## Find a large and diverse talent pool of available developers

Speaking of that streamlined development team, React Native has become increasingly popular over the past few years, leading to a large and diverse talent pool of available developers. With a shared codebase, you can hire a single development team to work on all platforms, rather than staffing separate teams for iOS, Android, and web. This means you won't have to worry about finding developers with experience in a specific platform, as many developers are already familiar with React Native or can quickly learn it. This makes it easier and more cost-effective to build and maintain your app over time, and provides you with a wider pool of talent to choose from when hiring. Additionally, because React Native has a robust open source community, you can find many resources and libraries to help you develop your app more quickly and efficiently.

## Your app will really and truly be an Android app and an iOS app (and whatever else you want it to be)

Your app will truly be a native Android or iOS app, even though it was built with React Native. React Native offers a high degree of fidelity with native platform components, such as tab bars, navigation drawers, and buttons. That means that your app won't just look like a native app - it will behave like one too. Additionally, you'll be able to access native device features like the camera, push notifications, and device storage. With React Native, you can build an app that fits in seamlessly with the rest of the apps on a user's device, without sacrificing the convenience of a shared codebase. Plus, because the code compiles down to the native platform, it's easier to debug and optimize for performance.

## Reduce platform risk: React Native isn't going anywhere

React Native isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Since its introduction by Facebook in 2015, React Native has gained significant momentum and a large community of developers who continue to support and improve the framework. As a result, there is little chance that React Native will suddenly become obsolete or unsupported, which means that choosing React Native for your app development will help reduce the platform risk. This means that your app will continue to be supported and updated for years to come, and you can rest assured that you won't be forced to rewrite it in a few years due to changes in technology or lack of support. By choosing a stable and well-supported platform like React Native, you can focus on building your app and growing your business.
