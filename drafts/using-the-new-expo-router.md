Use the new Expo router:
    - https://blog.expo.dev/rfc-file-system-based-routing-in-react-native-7a35474722a
    - Maybe a YouTube video?
    - Go through their major items and set up things I liked/didn't like.

Quick start: 

npx create-react-native-app -t with-router

Build a layout

Questions:

- Can I customize so it's not all just `app/`? Can I get a custom route?
- What is a good conventional initial stack name?
- Is a layout really a layout? Do all child screens get the wrapper?
