Let's say you write your own JavaScript modules and publish them to npm/yarn for use in your React Native application. Pure JS , but sort of "targeting" React Native.

Just bundle, but not minify your package
Do something else
Bonus: what patterns, tools, build step do you use for this kind of work?
