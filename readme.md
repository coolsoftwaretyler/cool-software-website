Fun weekend project - benchmarking MobX-State-Tree performance! We are working to make MST faster and use less memory. But we can't do that if we can't measure those things easily and accurately.

So I put together a multi-platform performance suite that allows us (and the MST community) to write benchmarking scenarios once and get statistically significant performance data across multiple execution environments.

This was super fun, and it's the foundation of big improvements to come for everyone using or considering using MobX-State-Tree!
