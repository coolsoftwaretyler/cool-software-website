I'm so excited to say I got a blog post published on the Expo Blog: [Win your March Madness bracket with this Expo app](https://expo.dev/blog/march-madness-expo-app/).

I am so grateful to the Expo team for reaching out and publishing about WalterPicks. I hope y'all enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it!
