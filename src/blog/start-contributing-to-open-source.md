I've seen new open source contributors thrive, and some of them get stuck and fizzle out. 

As one of the maintainers on [MobX-State-Tree](https://mobx-state-tree.js.org/intro/welcome), I'm always trying to help our contributors succeed and merge productive code to the project in a sustainable way.

I had the chance to talk about this with Rebecca Dodd for the Codecademy blog. I'm really grateful for the opportunity, and I hope this little blog post makes it at least a little easier for some folks to get started contributing to OSS. Check it out!
