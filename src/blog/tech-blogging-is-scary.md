I'm getting back into tech blogging. If you recognize my face or know me from elsewhere in the internet, you might have caught me over at [https://ogdenstudios.xyz](https://ogdenstudios.xyz) before. That link may or may not continue to work as I move on to a new phase in my professional life, but it was a blog I kept for the past five or so years, although I substantially slowed down with my posting in the recent past.

I've decided to breathe new life into my blogging habit with a slightly new brand (Cool Software, LLC), and a more narrow focus (React Native, Cloud Computing, and my own professional development). 

So like, that's exciting right? Who doesn't love a fresh start and a blank slate? 

## Nope, too scary.

Turns out... me? It's weird, I started my last blog as a complete beginner to software engineering. Five-ish years later, I'm at the very least, no longer "completely new" to the field. And my broadened awareness has paired up with some self-doubt to make this endeavor substantially harder than the last time I started a tech blog. 

Here are some things I'm afraid of: 

1. Do I need to be differentiated in some way?
1. If I am differentiating myself with specific technologies, have I chosen good ones to do that with?
1. Does anyone want to read this?
1. What if I am wrong about something, and people I respect find out that I don't know everything?
1. How can I be authentic, but also write professionally? 
1. What if I write a bunch and decide to change my niche and audience?
1. Whenever I find a "new" blog topic to write, I worry that I'm actually just wrong about something, and that's why no one has written about it before.
1. Whenever I try to write a topic about something I've seen before, everything feels either "obvious" to me and not worth mentioning, or I feel like someone has said it better before
1. What if people hate me?

Writing all that out makes me feel sillier, but also better. It's nice to identify the anxiety about blogging. I've been wringing my hands and writing half-assed outlines all week trying to find "the perfect" blog post. But like... there isn't one.

I settled on writing this reflection post instead, and I think it's going to be really instructive for the rest of my blog. 

## Ok, that's better, now what?

So yeah, it feels good to get some distance on my fears, and sitting down to write this blog post out has gotten me kind of un-stuck. 

So here's some thoughts about what I'm *excited* about, with regards to blogging: 

1. I think the anxiety is a message from deep within me that I'm afraid of failure, which means I'm putting myself in a position *to* fail, which tells me that I'm taking risks, and I'm probably gonna learn something at least.
1. It's extremely satisfying to get words on a page (or a markdown file, in my case)
1. I can't wait to have a body of work like these reflection posts to go back and see my progress
1. I'm excited to share all my posts (reflection posts and technical posts alike) with folks online.

## Giving myself structure

I respond well to structure: I like processes, feedback loops, and measuring goals. So my rough plan is inspired by [Chelsea Troy's post on warmup reading](https://chelseatroy.com/2018/07/12/leveling-up-skill-5-warmup-reading/) and her [post on active reading](https://chelseatroy.com/2018/08/22/level-up-skill-8-active-reading/). 

The plan is: 

1. Every week, engage in two warmup reading sessions between Monday-Friday.
1. Every week, write down ideas that come to me that could make a good "active reading" post where I do a deep dive on something interesting.
1. Every week, post a reflection post, to keep my writing muscles somewhat warmed up, and maybe help myself identify what I'm *really* thinking of week-to-week
1. Each 2-4 weeks, have one deep dive blog post in the works (perhaps inspired by Chelsea's active reading) that I'm excited to release into the world. Those ought to be instructive, educational, and hopefully more polished.

That's four execution points with some specific and measurable activities, but nothing too intense. I'm not going to put pressure on myself to write in-depth technical blog posts every week. I'm not going to optimize for SEO, I'm not even going to worry about mailing lists or any of those other things that people do with info-product-y blogs. That stuff can come after I've gotten some more reps with the new blog.

## Other thoughts

Here are some other things I wrote down in the last six days: 

This last week, I was able to find flow state by choosing fewer projects and really focusing on them. Getting into flow felt extremely good in the moment, and I found that I was happier through the week. I think my brain got some more space to mull over thoughts and concerns in my down time.

Taking time to clean up code is really important, and it pays off. We always think about it like "oh how can I justify to stakeholders taking time to refactor code and write tests and documentation?" But the answer is - we don't need to justify it to anyone, if we make it part of the table stakes. Tests, documentation, refactoring - that *is* the work, and when we do it, it pays dividends in the future. We don't need to feel guilty for doing a good job.

Finally, here's a list of blog posts I thought about writing, and their half-formed thesis/thoughts. If you're looking for ideas to write your *own* technical blog post about, feel free to steal any of these. Just let me know when you're done writing it, so I can write a response post to you (which would be a lot easier than doing the original one, haha).

1. Where do you write utility functions in your React Native projects? In the same file as the JSX? Next to the files that use it? In a different part of the project? Who knows? Not me. This is vaguely interesting to me, but it's a scary post to think about because it feels like lots of people are going to have lots of strong opinions.
1. Where do you put team documentation? Primarily I'm thinking about how discoverability is challenging. I mean, that's the whole reason search engines became a big business in the early internet, right? It's one thing to write notes about technical decisions, it's another to socialize those as your team grows. This is not a terribly interesting blog post to me, but it feels like something LinkedIn would like.
1. Technical blog post using the new Expo Router. This seems like it'll be a lot of fun to do, but pretty time intensive to say anything meaningful about it that the docs don't say.
1. "Focus" in React Native. People in the Infinite Red slack were asking about accessibility focus events, and I realized I don't know how they work/what's available. I know a lot about what web browsers make available, but almost nothing about Android or iOS. This also feels like a candidate for like... weeks of research.
1. JSX - how many expressions are too many? I have some opinions about this (if you have more than like, three conditional expressions in your JSX, you've missed an abstraction) - but I feel like this is another scary topic that's going to start a flame war and ultimately be a bunch of bikeshedding for little value. I might not touch this one.
1. Compare React Native data storage - compare different persistence methods, different client/server frameworks. This could be fun, but I really don't know where to begin, and it seems easy to miss big ones.
1. Best way to manage environment variables in React Native. I think this one could be more like, "how do environment variables get evaluated in React Native"? There's a lot of depth there. Could be a good deep dive.
1. A post about working with keyboard avoiding views. This... would be very challenging.
1. A post called "What [Gumrunner](https://yumaikas.itch.io/gum-runner) Taught Me about Software Engineering" - my friend built a *really* fun game that I played every night this last week, and it gave me the idea for a few fun metaphors. This is probably the next post I'm going to write about professional development. I'm stoked on that.
1. Shave your Yak - kind of like I mentioned in "not feeling bad about doing a good job" - this would be a post about the virtues of solving your own problems, even when they are orthogonal or even tangentially related to your work (within reason).
1. Deep dive on React Native fetch cookie-based authentication. This has bitten me a few times on projects, and I definitely want to dig in on the technical side here. Honestly it makes me want to submit a PR to try and solve the problem, but I don't actually have a fix for it, I just think it's an interesting problem to solve.
1. Omnitools and Flashlist - based on some FlashList restrictions, I have an idea about a UI pattern that preserves performance gains without compromising UX. This one is very very interesting to me. Should be high priority.
1. How to think about bundling (or not bundling) npm packages intended to be consumed by React Native apps. I got some good feedback in the Infinite Red slack channel about this.
1. Managing network requests and state - when and how do you initiate, retry, and handle errors in the network layer while working with React Native state? This one could be a thesis. Tough to write well but keep it concise. Maybe deserves a series. 
1. A listicle about what I love about React Native, and comparing it to web app development. This... also seems incendiary, so I may just send these thoughts to Twitter one at a time.
1. "Living" ES6 imports - when does your code get executed when you use ES6 imports. I think I can make this pretty tight, and I may end up writing it in a few days here. 
1. Testing React Native with Jest really helps you understand "What is it?" - a post about how testing gives you a sense of what your components really are as they exist in the run time.

Wowza, that's a lot of blog posts that I'm terrified to write. I suppose I'm going to have to... write them.

Anyway, that's the end of this stream of consciousness reflection post. Hopefully the first of many, and hopefully these will be interspersed at a reasonable cadence with technical info posts for y'all. 

If you stuck around with me, thanks! Let me know what you think, you can find me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/coolsoftwaredev) or [email me](mailto:tyler@coolsoftware.dev).
